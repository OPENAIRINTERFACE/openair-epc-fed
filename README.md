  Openair-cn is an implementation of the 3GPP specifications concerning the
  Evolved Packet Core Networks, that means it contains the implementation of the
  following network elements:

  * MME,
  * HSS,
  * S-GW+P-GW.

  Each element implementation has its own repository. This repository is a federation of components.

  Currently the purpose of this repository is mainly for CI activities and documentation.

  **AS OF 2022/02/25, WE HAVE OBSOLETED OUR LEGACY OAI-MME. THE ONLY RECOMMENDED AND SUPPORTED MME IS MAGMA-MME.**

  It is also hosting some tutorials:

  - [Deploying a whole EPC with MAGMA MME image](docs/DEPLOY_HOME_MAGMA_MME.md)
